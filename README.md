# DeviceUserInfoReader
Working Scanner, Still working on SQL

This is the Scanner App for User App (https://github.com/soboapps/DeviceInfo)

I wanted this to be able to do Inventory on a devices location within a building.  
User can check in at a location or check out of the building for the day.

Store the info in a DB
ToDo... Upload/Sync DB to a WebServer to track the Device.

Things I gathered are who it belonged to such as their Name, Email, Phone Number, SIM SN, Manufacturer, Model and Device SN. 
These things should not never duplicate and then this info could be use to uniquie identify the user and the device.

You could also use this to Check Vistors in and out of your office/lobby, 
such as (https://devpost.com/software/check-in-n-out) https://github.com/Lianathanoj/Check-In-N-Out
