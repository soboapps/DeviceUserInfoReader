# DeviceUserInfoReader

This is the Scanner App for User App (https://github.com/soboapps/DeviceInfo)

I wanted this to be able to do Track Users with a device as they come in and out like a log book.  
User would Scan in (Log in the Log Book) when they arrive check out (Log out of the Log Book) when they leave for the day.

Store the info in a DB
ToDo... Upload/Sync DB to a WebServer to track the Device.

Things I gathered are who it belonged to such as their Name, Email, Phone Number, SIM SN, Manufacturer, Model and Device SN. 
The Serial number should never duplicate so then this info could be use to identify the user and the device.

You could use this to Check Vistors in and out of any office or building.
